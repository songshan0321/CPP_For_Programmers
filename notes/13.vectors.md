# Vectors

Vectors are more versatile than arrays, and can be resized during runtime. We can also insert elements into a vector (we'll insert elements a little later in the lesson).

This characteristic adds a lot of freedom to vectors that we don't have with arrays. It also means we have to adjust how we access elements in a vector. Since we can add elements anywhere in the vector, we do not refer to the first element of a vector as the zero element, we call it the beginning. The last element is called end. To keep track of where we are in the vector, we need an **iterator**.

## Functions

* **resize()** - Changes the size of vector.

* **assign()** - Assign new values to the vector elements by replacing old ones.

* **push_back()** - Inserts new element at the end of vector and increases size of vector by one.

* **pop_back()** - Remove the last element of a vector.

* **begin()** - Return a random access iterator pointing to the first element of the vector.

* **insert()** - Adds elements to the location *after* the iterator.

* **emplace()** - Extends container by inserting new element at `position.`

* **clear()** - Remove all elements from the vector at the same time.

* **erase()** -  Delete a single element from a vector/ delete a range of elements form a vector

  

## Initiate a Vector

```c++
std::vector<int> vectorInts;  
```

For example:

- The vector has size 0 when we instantiate it.
- We use 'resize' to change the size of the vector.

```c++
// constructing vectors
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>  //Need to include the vector library!


int main ()
{
  //creating a vector of integers
  std::vector<int> vectorInts;  
  std::cout<<"vectorInts has "<<vectorInts.size()<<" elements\n";
  
  //Changing the size of vectorInts to 6
  vectorInts.resize(6);
  std::cout<<"\n\nvectorInts now has "<<vectorInts.size()<<" elements\n";
 
  return 0;
}
```

Output:

```
vectorInts has 0 elements

vectorInts now has 6 elements
```

## Iterators

In the program below, you should notice the following:

- We use ::assign to add and define elements to the vector
- We instantiate an iterator for the vector class:

```c++
//creating an iterator for the vector
std::vector<int>::iterator it;
```

- We use the iterator to cycle through the vector. Begin is the first element in the vector, end it the last.

```c++
  for (it = vectorInts.begin(); it != vectorInts.end(); ++it)
    std::cout<<*it<<" ";
```

* Notice, we dereference the iterator to print out the value of the vector:

```c++
std::cout<<*it<<" ";
```

* Notice, we have to increment the iterator as we execute the for loop.

```c++
for (it = vectorInts.begin(); it != vectorInts.end(); ++it)
```

```c++
// constructing vectors
// constructing vectors
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main ()
{
  //creating a vector of integers
  std::vector<int> vectorInts;  
  //creating an iterator for the vector
  std::vector<int>::iterator it;
  
  std::cout<<"vectorInts has "<<vectorInts.size()<<" elements\n";
  
  std::cout<<"\n\nAdding four elements to the vector\n";
  //assigning the value 3 to 4 elements of the vector
  vectorInts.assign(4,3);
  std::cout<<"vectorInts has "<<vectorInts.size()<<" elements\n";
  
  //printing the contents of vectorInts
  std::cout<<"VectorInts has these elements:\n";
  for (it = vectorInts.begin(); it != vectorInts.end(); ++it)
    std::cout<<*it<<" ";

  return 0;
}
```

Output: 

```
vectorInts has 0 elements

Adding four elements to the vector
vectorInts has 4 elements
VectorInts has these elements:
3 3 3 3 
```

## assign Elements

**::Assign writes over the elements in the vector.**

## push_back Elements

We can add elements to the end (or back) of a vector using ::push_back.

```c++
vectorInts.push_back(24);
```

Let's look at an example using push_back.

```c++
// constructing vectors
// constructing vectors
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main ()
{
  //creating a vector of integers
  std::vector<int> vectorInts;  
  //creating an iterator for the vector
  std::vector<int>::iterator it;
  
  std::cout<<"vectorInts has "<<vectorInts.size()<<" elements\n";
  
  std::cout<<"Adding 23 to the vector\n";
  vectorInts.assign(1,23);
  for (it = vectorInts.begin(); it != vectorInts.end(); ++it)
    std::cout<<*it<<" ";
  

  std::cout<<"\n\nAdding four elements to the vector\n";
  //assigning the value 3 to 4 elements of the vector
  vectorInts.push_back(24);
  vectorInts.push_back(25);
  vectorInts.push_back(26);
  vectorInts.push_back(27);
  std::cout<<"vectorInts has "<<vectorInts.size()<<" elements\n";
  
  //printing the contents of vectorInts
  std::cout<<"VectorInts has these elements:\n";
  for (it = vectorInts.begin(); it != vectorInts.end(); ++it)
    std::cout<<*it<<" ";
 
  return 0;
}
```

Output:

```
vectorInts has 0 elements
Adding 23 to the vector
23 

Adding four elements to the vector
vectorInts has 5 elements
VectorInts has these elements:
23 24 25 26 27 
```

## insert Elements

insert adds elements to the location *after* the iterator.

To add elements using insert:

- Set the iterator to one before the location where you would like to add an element.
- Use insert to add the element.

In the program below, note the following:

* Before we insert, we need to set the iterator to a known destination. In this case we set it to the beginning of the vector plus one.

  ```c++
it  = vectorInts.begin() + 1;
  ```

* To insert the element we need to give the insert location and the value of the element. In this case the location is the location of the iterator (begin + 1). The value is -1.

```c++
vectorInts.insert(it, -1);
```

Note:

You need to reset the iterator to the beginning of the vector before inserting the next value, because **all iterator locations are invalid after an insert**.

In this program I set the iterator to the beginning of the vector. Then during the insert I moved the iterator 3 locations to add the next element, which has a value of -2.

```c++
  it  = vectorInts.begin();
  vectorInts.insert(it + 3, -2);
```

```c++
// constructing vectors
// constructing vectors
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>


int main ()
{
  //creating a vector of integers
  std::vector<int> vectorInts;  
  //creating an iterator for the vector
  std::vector<int>::iterator it;

  vectorInts.push_back(0);
  vectorInts.push_back(1);
  vectorInts.push_back(2);
  vectorInts.push_back(3);
  vectorInts.push_back(4);
  vectorInts.push_back(5);
  vectorInts.push_back(6);
  vectorInts.push_back(7);
  
  std::cout<<"vectorInts has "<<vectorInts.size()<<" elements\n";
  
  //printing the contents of vectorInts
  std::cout<<"VectorInts has these elements:\n";
  for (it = vectorInts.begin(); it != vectorInts.end(); ++it)
    std::cout<<*it<<" ";
 
  //insert an element after the first element
  it  = vectorInts.begin() + 1;
  vectorInts.insert(it, -1);
  std::cout<<"\n\nAfter the insert\n";
for (it = vectorInts.begin(); it != vectorInts.end(); ++it)
    std::cout<<*it<<" ";
    
  //insert an element after the third element
  it  = vectorInts.begin();
  vectorInts.insert(it + 3, -2);
  std::cout<<"\n\nAfter the insert\n";
for (it = vectorInts.begin(); it != vectorInts.end(); ++it)
    std::cout<<*it<<" ";

  //insert an element after the third element
  it  = vectorInts.begin();
  vectorInts.insert(it + 5, -3);
  std::cout<<"\n\nAfter the insert\n";
for (it = vectorInts.begin(); it != vectorInts.end(); ++it)
    std::cout<<*it<<" ";
    
  return 0;
}
```

Output:

```
vectorInts has 8 elements
VectorInts has these elements:
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 

After the insert
0 -1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 

After the insert
0 -1 1 -2 2 3 4 5 6 7 

After the insert
0 -1 1 -2 2 -3 3 4 5 6 7 
```

## emplace Elements

Emplace puts an element in a vector at the position pointed to by the iterator.

Emplace differs from insert in the method used to insert the element. Insert **copies** the values of the vector while emplace does an **in-place insertion**. This means the insertion occurs at the point after the iterator.

```c++
  //insert an element after the first element
  it  = vectorInts.begin() + 1;
  vectorInts.emplace(it, -1);
```

## clear Vector

```c++
 //clear the vector
  vectorInts.clear();
```

## erase Element

::erase can:

- delete a single element from a vector For example:

  ```c++
  //erase the 5th element in the vector
  vectorInts.erase(vectorInts.begin()+4);
  ```

- delete a range of elements form a vector For example:

  ```c++
  //erase a range of elements in the vector
  vectorInts.erase(vectorInts.begin()+1, vectorInts.begin()+3);
  ```

## pop_back Element

We can remove the last element of a vector using ::pop_back.

For example:

```c++
  //pop the last element off the vector
  vectorInts.pop_back();
```

**Note:** pop_back *DOES NOT* return a value!
