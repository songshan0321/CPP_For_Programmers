## Switch Statements

The format for a switch statement:

```c++
switch(expression)
{
     case constant-expression : statements;
                               break; (this is optional);
     case constant-expression : statements;
                               break; (this is optional);
     ...

     default : //optional
        statements;
}
```

## for loops

There is one small note I would like to add, it is concerning the use of an alias: 

```
size_t
```

This alias in found in the cstddef library. To use size_t you will have to include the cstddef library.

You can use size_t in a loop where you would normally define the variable type of the iterator.

For example:

```c++
for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++)		
```

Becomes:

```c++
#include <cstddef> //don't forget to include the library
.
.
.
for(size_t i =0; i<5; i++)
```

## do... while loop

C++ do ... while loops have the following syntax:

```c++
do
{
     statements;
}while(condition );
```

## Infinite loop

Sometimes it is desired to create an infinite loop. For example, in embedded systems a infinite loop is often used for the main task.

**To create an infinite loop using a for loop:**

```c++
for( ; ;)
{
     std::cout<<"This for loop will run forever\n";
}
```

**To create an infinite loop using a while loop:**

```c++
while(1)
{
     std::cout<<"This while loop will run forever\n";
}
```

## Exiting Loops

**The break statement:**

The break statement will end the loop and begin executing the first statement that comes AFTER the end of the loop.

**The continue statement:** The continue statement will force the next iteration to be executed.
