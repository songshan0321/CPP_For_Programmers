## 3. Arithmetic operations

### Arithmetic operations

```include <cmath>``` for library.

```c++
#include<cmath>

//pi is equal to M_PI
M_PI = 3.14159265358979323846

//3^5 is equal to std::pow(3, 5)
std::pow(3, 5)
```

### Variable Assignment

C++ is a language that requires variable types to be known at compile time.

But, C++ does allow some implicit conversions, for example an integer can be assigned to a float or an integer can be treated as a char. 

## PreFix and PostFix

In C++, as in many languages, there are postfix and prefix operators. 
The form for each is:

Incrementing

prefix: ++a
postfix: a++
Decrementing

prefix: --a
postfix: a--
The difference between prefix and postfix is subtle, but crucial. 

Prefix operators increment the value of the variable, then return the reference to the variable. 

Postfix operators create a copy of the variable and increments the value of the variable. Then it returns a copy from BEFORE the increment.
