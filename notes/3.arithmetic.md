## PreFix and PostFix

In C++, as in many languages, there are postfix and prefix operators. 
The form for each is:

Incrementing

prefix: ++a
postfix: a++
Decrementing

prefix: --a
postfix: a--
The difference between prefix and postfix is subtle, but crucial. 

Prefix operators increment the value of the variable, then return the reference to the variable. 

Postfix operators create a copy of the variable and increments the value of the variable. Then it returns a copy from BEFORE the increment.
