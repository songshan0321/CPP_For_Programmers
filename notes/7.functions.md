# Function

Minimal exampele:

```c++
/*Goal: practice functions that do not return
**a value and do not accept parameters
*/

#include<iostream>

void printMessage(); //note, this is placed BEFORE main()

int main()
{
    printMessage();
    return 0;
}

//note, the definition is conventionally placed after main
void printMessage() 
{
    std::cout<<"HEY! I'm from a function!";
}
```
### How to Alter Parameters Outside of the Function Scope

### So, now we know that C++ respects variable scope. Changes to a variable that are made in a function will not effect the variable in the main part of the program.   There are two methods to rectify this situation:Return the altered variablePass the variable as a reference

We know how to return a variable. So we can modify the program to return 'a'.

```c++
/*The program is changed to return 
**the modified variable 'a'
**
**P.S. This is a totally silly program. Why write a function, 
**with all the function overhead, to increment a variable?
**Silly!
*/

#include<iostream>

int increment(int input);
int main()
{
    int a = 34;
    std::cout<<"Before the function call a = "<<a<<"\n";
    a = increment(a);
    std::cout<<"After the function call a = "<<a<<"\n";
    return 0;
}
int increment(int input)
{
    input++;
    std::cout<<"In the function call a = "<<input<<"\n";
    return input;
}
```

### The second method for effecting variables outside of their scope, is to pass by reference. 

Passing by reference refers to passing **the address of the variable** rather than the variable. Then when we make a change in a function, we are changing the value at the address, not the variable. Once the value is changed at its address, any access to that address will retrieve the new value. 

```c++
/*Goal: Learn to pass variables by reference. 
**Once we learn this, we can modify variables in functions,
**and the change will be available outside the scope of the 
**modification.
*/

#include<iostream>

void increment(int &input); //Note the addition of '&'

int main()
{
    int a = 34;
    std::cout<<"Before the function call a = "<<a<<"\n";
    increment(a);
    std::cout<<"After the function call a = "<<a<<"\n";
    return 0;
}
void increment(int &input)//Note the addition of '&'
{
    input++; //**Note the LACK OF THE addition of '&'**
    std::cout<<"In the function call a = "<<input<<"\n";
}
```

Output:

``````
Before the function call a = 34
In the function call a = 35
After the function call a = 35
``````



## Arrays as Parameters

C++ does not allow arrays to be passed to functions, but, as we have seen, it does allow pointers to be passed. 

There are three methods for passing an array by reference to a function:

- void functionName(variableType *arrayName)
- void functionName(variableType arrayName[length of array])
- void functionName(variableType arrayName[])

Let's look at each method in the program below.

```c++
/*Goal: Learn to pass arrays to functions*/

#include<iostream>
#include<iomanip>

//Pass the array as a pointer
void arrayAsPointer(int *array, int size);
//Pass the array as a sized array
void arraySized(int array[3], int size);
//Pass the array as an unsized array
void arrayUnSized(int array[], int size);

int main()
{
    const int size = 3;
    int array[size] = {33,66,99};
    //We are passing a pointer or reference to the array
    //so we will not know the size of the array
    //We have to pass the size to the function as well
    arrayAsPointer(array, size);
    arraySized(array, size);
    arrayUnSized(array, size);
    return 0;
}

void arrayAsPointer(int *array, int size)
{
    std::cout<<std::setw(5);
    for(int i=0; i<size; i++) 
        std::cout<<array[i]<<" ";
    std::cout<<"\n";
}

void arraySized(int array[3], int size)
{
    std::cout<<std::setw(5);
    for(int i=0; i<size; i++)
        std::cout<<array[i]<<" ";
    std::cout<<"\n";  
}

void arrayUnSized(int array[], int size)
{
    std::cout<<std::setw(5);
    for(int i=0; i<size; i++)
        std::cout<<array[i]<<" ";
    std::cout<<"\n";  
}
```

Output:

```
   33 66 99 
   33 66 99 
   33 66 99 
```

## Function Best Practices

When creating functions there is a precaution that is often considered a 'best practice'. 
When passing variables that are not going to be modified in the function, define the variable as a 'const' so that it cannot be changed by the function. 
For example:
In this function, we are passing an integer variable called input. We want the function to use it and not modify it. So we will give it a variable type that is a const int. 
Function Delcaration

```c++
int doubleInput(const int input)
```

Function Definition

```c++
int doubleInput(const int input)
{
    int h = input *2;
    return h;
}
```

#### This code will not compile:

I have modified the variable input. In the declaration and definition I said this value would not be modified.

```c++
int doubleInput(const int input)
{
    input++;
    int h = input *2;
    return h;
}
```
