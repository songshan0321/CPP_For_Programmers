**Compiling**

![1532050128427](/tmp/1532050128427.png)

Compiling is the process of translating the code that you've written into machine code that processors understand. Every program, regardless of the source language, needs to be compiled in order to execute. This is true even for scripting languages like Python or JavaScript. In these cases, the interpreter (or a similar system) is responsible for compiling code on the fly in a process known as [just-in-time compiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation). 

Unlike scripted languages, compiled languages treat compilation and execution as two distinct steps. Compiling a program leaves you with an [executable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable) (often called a "binary"), a non-human readable file with machine code that the processor can run.

The nice thing about binaries is that they're generally distributable. 

There is a high-level build tool called **CMake** that is fairly popular and cross-platform. CMake in and of itself, however, does not compile code. CMake results in compilation configurations. It depends on a lower-level build tool called **Make** to *manage* compiling from source. And then Make depends on a compiler to do the actual compiling.

### Object Files

Compiling source code, like a single .cpp file, results in something called an [object file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_file). An object file contains machine code but may not be executable in and of itself. Among other things, object files describe their own public APIs (usually called symbols) as well as references that need to be resolved from other object files. Depended upon object files might come from other source files within the same project or from external or system libraries.

In order to be executable, object files need to be linked together.

**Linking**

Linking is the process of creating an executable by effectively combining object files. During the linking process, the linker (the thing that does the linking) resolves symbolic references between object files and outputs a self-contained binary with all the machine code needed to execute.

As an aside, linking is not required for all programs. Most operating systems allow **dynamic linking**, in which symbolic references point to libraries that are not compiled into the resulting binary. With dynamic linking, these references are resolved at runtime. An example of this is a program that depends on a system library. At runtime, the symbolic references of the program resolve to the symbols of the system library.

**In summary to compile in a terminal:**

* Open a terminal window
* change the working directory to the directory of the program
* Make sure names of folders and files do not have spaces in them
* To compile the program: g++ filename.cpp -o executableName
* To execute the program: ./executableName

Common mistakes when executing in the terminal:

* Make sure there are no spaces in filenames
* Make sure all the files you need are in the working directory (including header files), use 'ls' to check
