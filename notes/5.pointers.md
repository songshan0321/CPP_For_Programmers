# Pointers

Pointers, which are the addresses of variables, can be accessed in C++.

For example in this code snippet:

```
     int a = 54;
```

54 is the value of the variable, in other words, it is the value that is stored in the location reserved the the variable called 'a'.

Now, let's ask ourselves, **where is a?** The location of 'a' can be found using a pointer!

```
     int a = 54;
     std::cout<< &a<<"\n"; //This will print the LOCATION of 'a'
```

More information about pointers can be found at: [Pointers](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/pointers/)

### Try pointers in the program below.

```c++
/*Goal: Examine pointers!*/

#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int a = 54;
    std::cout<<"a = "<<a<<"\n";
    std::cout<<"address of a is at &a = "<< &a<<"\n";
    return 0;
}
```

## Dereferencing Pointers

But what if we have a pointer and want to access the value stored in that address? That process is called *dereferencing*, and it is indicated by adding the operator `*` before the variable's name. This same operator should be used to declare a variable that is meant to store a pointer.

For example:

```
 // this is an integer variable with value = 54
int a = 54; 

// this is a pointer that holds the address of the variable 'a'.
// if 'a' was a float, rather than int, so should be its pointer.
int * pointerToA = &a;  

// If we were to print pointerToA, we'd obtain the address of 'a':
std::cout << "pointerToA stores " << pointerToA << '\n';

// If we want to know what is stored in this address, we can dereference pointerToA:
std::cout << "pointerToA points to " << * pointerToA << '\n';
```

### More examples:

```c++
/*Goal: Find out why you care about pointers*/

#include<iostream>
#include<string>

int main ()
{
  int * pointerI;
  int number;
  char character;
  char * pointerC;
  std::string sentence;
  std::string *pointerS;
  
  pointerI = &number;
  *pointerI = 45;
  
  pointerC = &character;
  *pointerC = 'f';
  
  pointerS = &sentence;
  *pointerS = "Hey look at me, I know pointers!";
  
  std::cout << "number = "<<number<<"\n";
  std::cout<<"character = "<<character<<"\n";
  std::cout<<"sentence = "<<sentence<<"\n";

  return 0;
}
```
