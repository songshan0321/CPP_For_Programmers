# Classes

**We can use functions to access the data in a class.**

Functions that access and/or modify data values in classes are called mutators. 
Check this page to learn more about [Mutators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutator_method)

Add the keyword "public" and all members listed after it are accessible:

The syntax for a class is:

```c++
class ClassName
{
      member1;
      member2;
      ...

public:
     return variable accessFunction1(function parameters);
     return variable accessFunction2(function parameters); 
      ...
} ;

returnVariable ClassName:: accessFunction1(function parameters)
{
    function statements;
}

returnVariable ClassName:: accessFunction2(function parameters)
{
    function statements;
}

...
```

**C++ Convention is:**

Capitalize the first letter of the classname.

```c++
class ClassName
```

Private members are listed first. If you do this, there is no need to use the 'private' keyword. If you list them after the public keyword, you will need to identify them using the private keyword.

```c++
{
      member1;
      member2;
      ...
```

Use 'getVariableName' for accessing private variables Use 'setVariableName' for assigning values to private variables

```c++
public:
     return variable accessFunction1(function parameters);
     return variable accessFunction2(function parameters); 
      ...
} ;
```

You will need to signify that the functions are part of the class definition by using the namespace classname::.

```c++
returnVariable ClassName:: accessFunction1(function parameters)
{
    function statements;
}

returnVariable ClassName:: accessFunction2(function parameters)
{
    function statements;
}
```



## Constructors

**There is a special function member that we need to talk about, constructors.** 
A constructor is special function that is executed whenever we create a new instance of the class. It is used to set initial values of data members of the class. 
**Constructors do not return a value, including void.** 
The declaration for a constructor is:

```
ClassName::ClassName();
```

The definition of a constructor is:

```
ClassName::ClassName()
{
     dataMemberName1 = value;
     dataMemberName2 = value;
     ...
}
```



## Destructors

Destructors are special class functions that are called whenever an object goes out of scope. Just like a constructor, a destructor is called automatically.

- Destructors **cannot**:

  ```
     - return a value
     - accept parameters
  ```

- Destructors must have the same name as the class.

The syntax for a destructor is similar to the constructor:

The destructor is identified with a tilda (~) symbol.

Declaring a destructor:

```
~className()  //this is a destructor
```

Defining a destructor:

```
classname::~classname()
{
     //tasks to be completed before going out of scope
}
```

One of the more important tasks of a destructor is releasing memory that was allocated by the class constructor and member functions.

We will discuss this in detail during the memory allocation lesson.

## Helper Functions in Classes

Classes can have member functions that do more than just set or get data values. These helper functions can perform tasks that are often requested or are easier to perform in the class itself.Â 

For example: Let's say we have a class that tracks the grades a student receives in a course. We can create a member function that calculates the average.

## This pointer

C++ has a pointer called 'this'.

'this' returns its own address.

There are a few cases where 'this' might be necessary, but often using it is considered a stylistic preference.

Note in the program below, to compare the Area of the Shape's own area with the area of the shape

```c++
  //Use 'this' to compare areas
 //The class functions
      int compareWithThis(Shape shape) 
      {
         //return the area of the calling shape
         return this->Area() > shape.Area(); 
      }
```

```c++
   //Using the class function in a program
   //In this case sh1.Area() is being compared to sh2.Area()

   if(sh1.compareWithThis(sh2)) {
      cout << "\nShape2 is smaller than Shape1" <<endl;
   } 
```

I can perform the exact same function and not use 'this'.

```c++
     //'this' is not necessary to compare shapes
      int compare(Shape shapeIn) 
      {
         return Area() > shapeIn.Area();
      }
```

To use the class function:

```c++
   if(sh1.compare(sh2)) 
   {
      cout << "\nShape2 is smaller than Shape1" <<endl;
   } 
```
